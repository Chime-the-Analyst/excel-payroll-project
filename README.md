# Project Name: Excel Payroll Project

I did a project using Microsoft Excel. It's a beginner project and this is its documentation.

## Project Background
The project is a payroll spreadsheet of a hypothetical company. I'm the manager of that company and I oversee the payment of the employees.

## Steps taken to get dataset ready
The dataset is fictional and I made up the values. I got the names used in the dataset online. I google baby names and copied and pasted them in a word document.
